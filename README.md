# OpenSignup

Ad-free, open-source coordination for school parents, coaches, and community organizers.

A modern, self-hostable sign-up and volunteer coordination tool.

- **Slots are the atom, not questions.** Commitments, capacity, reminders — not form fields.
- **Participants are not users.** No account required, ever, to sign up.
- **Self-hostable from day one.** `git clone`, one Docker Compose, zero vendor accounts required.
- **AI-native.** Clean primitives designed for Claude, MCP, and future agent surfaces.

## Quickstart (five minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/richshaw/OpenSignup.git && cd OpenSignup
cp .env.example .env.local
docker compose up -d           # local Postgres on :5433
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev                        # http://localhost:3000
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
pnpm worker                     # reminder worker
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, request a magic link with any email, and look at the server log — with `EMAIL_TRANSPORT=console`, login links are printed directly to stdout for local development.

## Self-host

Docker image is published to GHCR on release. See `docker-compose.yml` for the canonical setup (app + db + worker). Configuration is entirely via environment variables — see `.env.example`.

Email transport is pluggable (`console` for dev, `smtp` for generic self-host, `resend` for hosted). No other external accounts required.
